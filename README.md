Big2: board game

Big Two is a very popular game in the Far East, including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malasya and Taiwan. As in the most oriental games, each player can play a combination of cards (which should contain one, two, three or five cards), and the goal is to get rid of all his cards before the other players.
